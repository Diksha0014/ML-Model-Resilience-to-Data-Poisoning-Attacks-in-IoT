# ML Model Resilience to Data Poisoning Attacks in IoT

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes the resilience of classical Machine Learning models against data poisoning attacks in IoT environments. The focus is on evaluating how model performance changes before and after optimization.

The project is based entirely on classical machine learning techniques and does not use deep learning models.
